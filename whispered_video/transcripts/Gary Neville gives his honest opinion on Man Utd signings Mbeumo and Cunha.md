Since the 1990s, over the last 10 or 11 years of sort of accepted a position whereby it

made mistakes in the transfer of the market or made mistakes in recruitment or they've

held on to players too long, it would seem that to be fair what's happening now is that

urban armour is identifying players. He's just not one in the squad and to be fair, he's

moving them out of the squad. That's a positive. The second thing is I do like on paper, the

signings of Cunia and Burmob. Why do I like them? A couple of reasons. Well, three actually,

one is that they've got Premier League experience. One is that they look more like Man's

U90 styles of players, with a more pace and power and the ability to have that sort of

physicality to be able to get from box to box quickly. I think when you look at particularly

in that show, Sand Show, Anthony, they're marching because I call them more people who sort of

working tight spaces. I've always felt that in ITG need players that can open the legs up and

really sort of stretch teams. I think Cunia and Burmob do that. And then the other thing I like about

those two signings is that they've not proved themselves at the highest level yet in the

game in respect to the Premier League club level or European club level. So they should be

really desperate and hungry to prove themselves on a huge stage, which is all trafficked. And

that Cunia hasn't always been there in the last 10 years with players that have come to the club.

They've come maybe where they've been the more finished article and we've got excited by them,

but maybe they've come and maybe not at that desperation. I always feel like a player needs

longer than he desperation in the game to feel it. It's the most important thing. I think these

two lads that assign will have that. So I think the two signings are good signings yet. There's

a couple more needed. I think they need a goalkeeper. They need to send it forward. And I think

if they fill those two positions with decent signings, then you need to have to have to have

a better season in the last year. It can't get any worse really. I think there's a couple more
