# Solo Developer CI/CD Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Workflow Overview

This CI/CD setup is optimized for solo development with two main workflows:

### 1. **Quick Development Test** (Feature Branch)
- **Trigger**: Push to `feature` branch
- **Purpose**: Fast feedback during development
- **Duration**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Checks**: Basic syntax, unit tests, Docker build

### 2. **Full CI/CD Pipeline** (Main Branch)
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
- **Purpose**: Production-ready validation
- **Duration**: ~5-8 minutes
- **Checks**: Full quality checks, security scanning, coverage reporting

## ðŸš€ Development Workflow

### Daily Development Process:

```bash
# 1. Start development on feature branch
git checkout feature

# 2. Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Test locally (optional but recommended)
cd estfor
pytest tests/test_unit.py
docker build -t estfor:local .

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature

# 5. Check GitHub Actions for quick feedback
# Go to: https://github.com/Mohamed-diabakhate/monolith/actions
```

### Production Deployment:

```bash
# 1. Merge feature branch to main
git checkout main
git merge feature
git push origin main

# 2. GitHub Actions automatically runs full CI/CD
# 3. Check results and deploy if successful
```

## ðŸ“Š Workflow Details

### Quick Development Test (`quick-dev.yml`)
**Runs on**: `feature` branch pushes
**Checks**:
- âœ… Python syntax validation
- âœ… Basic unit tests
- âœ… Docker build verification
- âœ… Fast feedback (2-3 minutes)

### Solo CI/CD (`solo-cicd.yml`)
**Runs on**: Both `feature` and `main` branches
**Feature Branch**:
- âœ… Quick code quality check
- âœ… Basic tests with coverage
- âœ… Docker build and test
- âœ… Development feedback

**Main Branch**:
- âœ… Full code quality checks (Black, isort, flake8, mypy)
- âœ… Comprehensive testing with coverage reporting
- âœ… Security scanning (Bandit, Trivy)
- âœ… Production Docker build
- âœ… Production deployment preparation

### Full Build & Test (`build.yaml`)
**Runs on**: `main` branch and PRs to main
**Checks**:
- âœ… Complete quality pipeline
- âœ… Full test suite with coverage
- âœ… Security vulnerability scanning
- âœ… Container security analysis
- âœ… Codecov integration

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### For Daily Development:
1. **Always work on feature branch** for new features/fixes
2. **Push frequently** to get quick feedback
3. **Check Actions tab** after each push
4. **Fix issues early** before they accumulate

### For Production:
1. **Merge to main** only when feature is complete
2. **Review all CI/CD checks** before considering deployment
3. **Monitor security scan results**
4. **Check coverage reports** for test quality

### Local Testing (Recommended):
```bash
# Quick local test before pushing
cd estfor
pytest tests/test_unit.py -v

# Code quality check
black --check .
flake8 .

# Docker build test
docker build -t estfor:local .
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Triggering:
- Check if files changed are in monitored paths
- Verify you're on the correct branch
- Check GitHub Actions is enabled for repository

### Tests Failing:
- Run tests locally first: `pytest tests/`
- Check for missing dependencies
- Verify Python version compatibility

### Docker Build Failing:
- Test locally: `docker build -t estfor:test .`
- Check Dockerfile syntax
- Verify all required files are present

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch:
- **Build Success Rate**: Should be >95%
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for >80%
- **Security Issues**: Address all high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Build Time**: Quick dev <3min, Full CI <10min

### GitHub Actions Dashboard:
- **URL**: https://github.com/Mohamed-diabakhate/monolith/actions
- **Monitor**: Workflow success rates and execution times
- **Review**: Failed builds and error messages

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

### Development Success:
- âœ… Quick tests pass consistently
- âœ… Docker builds without errors
- âœ… Code quality checks pass
- âœ… Fast feedback loop (<3 minutes)

### Production Success:
- âœ… All quality gates pass
- âœ… Security scans clean
- âœ… Test coverage maintained
- âœ… Production deployment ready

**Remember**: This setup is designed for efficiency. Use the quick tests for development feedback and the full pipeline for production confidence.
